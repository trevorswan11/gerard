That baby bird was tiny, it didn't even have all of its feathers, and it couldn't sing. When we found it, it was already on its last breath, having fallen into a shrub — probably abandoned by its parents. We decided to build a nest for it right there and then. However, thinking back, that winter was unusually cold, with fierce winds at night in the yard, not to mention the many poisonous bugs and wild beasts in the vicinity... It was clear that if we left the fledgling in the yard, it stood no chance of surviving until spring. So, I suggested we take it inside, place it on the shelf by the window, and asked the adults to fashion a cage for it. We decided that when it regained its strength enough to spread its wings, we would release it back into the wild. The tragic part — something that we'd never considered — was that this bird's fate had already been determined long before this moment... Its destiny was determined by our momentary whim. Now, I pass the power of choice to you all. Faced with this situation, what choice would you make? Stick to the original plan, and build a nest with soft net where the Charmony Dove fell? Or build a cage for it, and feed it, giving it the utmost care from within the warmth of a home? I eagerly await your answer"),

How could anyone appreciate him when all he does is bring a big shield? I was able to clear Simulated Universe World 1 with NO shielder, and people tell me that I need a defensive unit? Yes I died to World 1 over 20 times, but I wasn't trying to be fair. Why would I need a shielder if my team of Sampo/Hook/Dan Heng/Tingyun is clearly one of the BEST teams in the game? I don't have skill issue and I don't like hot men. I especially don't like hot sexy men like Gepard, who want to do nothing but protect me. I don't need protection and I certainly DON'T need a hot sexy man like Gepard on my roster. What do people even see in him? A kind, compassionate, and caring individual who looks after his family and city? How could anyone actually be ok with getting Gepard off of their Departure Warp? It's simply logical that NO ONE should appreciate Gepard. It's such a ludicrous idea that anyone would want Gepard's muscular arms wrapped around them while they cuddle in bed at night after a wonderful night out in Belobog. What a silly concept"),
